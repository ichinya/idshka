# AIF Done

AIFHub/Handoff finalization skill. Finalizes a verified OpenSpec-native change or a legacy AI Factory-only plan, drafts commit and PR summaries, drives evidence-backed governance follow-ups, and can run or recommend evolution follow-ups.

This skill does not duplicate `/aif-verify` — it runs **after** a passing verification (PASS or PASS-with-notes).

Resolve mode from `.ai-factory/config.yaml`:

- Use OpenSpec-native mode when `aifhub.artifactProtocol: openspec`.
- Use Legacy AI Factory-only mode otherwise.

## OpenSpec-native mode

OpenSpec-native mode finalizes the verified change state through `scripts/openspec-done-finalizer.mjs`. It is the only OpenSpec-native archive/finalization step after `/aif-verify` passes.

### Preconditions

- Resolve exactly one active change or explicit `<change-id>`.
- Read QA evidence from `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`.
- Treat verification as passing only when QA evidence clearly records a final PASS or PASS-with-notes for this change.
- Require the latest final fenced `aif-gate-result` block in `verify.md` to be valid JSON with `"gate": "verify"` and `status` of `pass` or `warn`.
- If verification has not run or verdict is `fail`, stop and suggest `/aif-verify` or `/aif-fix`.
- If the verify gate result is missing, invalid, or `fail`, stop and suggest rerunning `/aif-verify <change-id>` or `/aif-fix <change-id>`.
- Refuse unverified changes; do not accept `Code verification: PENDING` as final verification.
- Check dirty working tree state before archive and either fail or record it only when explicit dirty-state recording is requested.

### Canonical Context

Read canonical OpenSpec artifacts:

- `openspec/specs/**`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md`

Read generated rules as derived guidance when present:

- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-merged-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-change-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-base.md`

Runtime state and QA evidence live outside canonical changes:

- `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/`
- `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`

### Archive Policy

- Archive through `archiveOpenSpecChange(changeId, options)` from `scripts/openspec-runner.mjs`; this corresponds to `openspec archive <change-id> --yes`.
- Use `archiveOpenSpecChange(changeId)` for normal finalization.
- Use `archiveOpenSpecChange(changeId, { skipSpecs: true })` for docs/tooling-only finalization; this corresponds to `openspec archive <change-id> --yes --skip-specs --no-color`.
- Support the user-facing `--skip-specs` path while still writing final QA evidence and final summaries.
- If OpenSpec CLI is missing or unsupported and archive is required, fail with an explicit OpenSpec CLI requirement.
- Do not archive in `/aif-verify`; `/aif-verify` does not archive and only records verification evidence.
- Do not use legacy `.ai-factory/specs` archive in OpenSpec-native mode.
- OpenSpec-native mode does not use legacy `.ai-factory/specs` archive.
- Do not silently archive OpenSpec changes through legacy `.ai-factory/specs`.
- Do not write runtime-only output into `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`.
- Do not directly mutate `openspec/specs/**` or manually move OpenSpec change folders.

### OpenSpec-Native Output

Normal output must report:

- selected `change-id`;
- verification status and refusal reason when unverified;
- dirty working tree state;
- archive result;
- canonical artifacts inspected;
- generated rules state when relevant;
- runtime state and QA evidence paths;
- final evidence under `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`;
- final summaries under `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/`;
- commit/PR summary draft.

## Legacy AI Factory-only mode

Legacy AI Factory-only mode preserves the verified plan finalization contract based on `.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>/` and `.ai-factory/specs/<plan-id>/`.

### Precondition

- Active plan must have a passing verification state (`pass` or `pass-with-notes`).
- If verification has not run or verdict is `fail`, this skill stops and suggests running `/aif-verify` first.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Precondition

1. Resolve the active plan (same resolution logic as `/aif-implement`).
2. Read `status.yaml` and check `verification.verdict`.
3. If verdict is missing or not `pass`/`pass-with-notes`:
   - Stop with message: "Plan has not passed verification. Run `/aif-verify` first."
4. Check workspace state:
   - If `git status` shows uncommitted changes **outside** the current plan scope:
     - Stop and ask the user to confirm or clean up.
     - Only plan-related changes (files touched by the plan's implementation) are acceptable without confirmation.

#### Step 2: Archive Plan

1. Resolve archive path: `.ai-factory/specs/<plan-id>/`.
2. **Idempotency check:** If `.ai-factory/specs/<plan-id>/` already exists:
   - Treat the run as a refresh/finalize-again pass.
   - Rebuild `spec.md`, refresh the index entry, and regenerate commit/PR/follow-up outputs from current plan evidence.
   - If the archive came from legacy `/aif-verify` auto-archive behavior, adopt it instead of failing or blindly re-copying.
   - Inform the user that finalization is refreshing an existing archive.
3. If archive does not exist:
   - Copy plan folder contents (minus `status.yaml` execution metadata) into the archive.
   - Archive the companion plan file as `plan.md` alongside the folder artifacts.
4. Create or update `spec.md` summarizing what was implemented, if part of the current contract.
5. Update `.ai-factory/specs/index.yaml` with the new entry.

#### Step 3: Prepare Commit Message

1. Analyze all changes made under this plan.
2. Draft a conventional commit message summarizing the implementation.
3. Present the draft to the user for review.

#### Step 4: Prepare PR Summary (if applicable)

1. Check if a feature branch exists (branch != main/master).
2. If `gh` CLI is available:
   - Draft PR title and body based on plan scope and implementation evidence.
   - Present the draft; do not create the PR automatically.
3. If `gh` is not available:
   - Output manual PR instructions with the drafted title and body.

#### Step 5: Apply Evidence-Driven Follow-ups

1. Check plan for evidence of:
   - roadmap milestone completion or maturity movement;
   - new architecture decisions, boundaries, or modules;
   - new or modified durable project rules;
   - evolution candidates worth feeding into `/aif-evolve`.
2. Apply follow-ups only when the evidence exists:
   - Roadmap -> update through the roadmap owner or return an exact `/aif-roadmap` handoff.
   - Architecture -> update through the architecture owner or return an exact `/aif-architecture` handoff.
   - Rules -> update the project rules owner path or return an exact handoff if direct update is not safe in the current runtime.
3. If the current runtime cannot safely perform the owner update, do not silently skip it — return the exact next command/instruction instead.
4. Run `/aif-evolve` when the user explicitly asked for integrated finalization and the runtime can chain the action; otherwise propose it as the next step.
5. Never invent governance changes that are not supported by plan evidence.

#### Step 6: Mark Plan Done

1. Update `status.yaml`:
   - Set `status: done`.
   - Record finalization timestamp.
2. Output completion summary:
   - Archive path.
   - Commit message draft.
   - PR summary draft (or manual instructions).
   - Governance updates performed or exact handoffs prepared.
   - `/aif-evolve` action taken or recommended.

## Ownership Boundary

| Artifact | Owner | This Skill |
|----------|-------|------------|
| `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` | OpenSpec-native workflow | Reads before archive; OpenSpec CLI owns lifecycle mutation |
| `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/` | `/aif-verify` and **aif-done** | Reads verification evidence; writes `done.md`, `openspec-archive.json`, and raw archive output |
| `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` | OpenSpec-native runtime and **aif-done** | Reads traces; writes `final-summary.md` |
| `.ai-factory/specs/<plan-id>/` | **aif-done** legacy mode only | Creates or refreshes on legacy finalization |
| `.ai-factory/specs/index.yaml` | **aif-done** | Updates |
| `.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>/status.yaml` | **aif-done** | Updates `status: done` |
| Commit/PR drafts | **aif-done** | Outputs to user |
| `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` | roadmap owner | Update only with plan-backed evidence; otherwise hand off |
| `.ai-factory/RULES.md` | project rules owner | Update only for durable plan-backed rules; otherwise hand off |
| `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` | architecture owner | Update only with plan-backed evidence; otherwise hand off |

## Rules

- Never finalize a plan that has not passed verification.
- In OpenSpec-native mode, never finalize an unverified change.
- In OpenSpec-native mode, archive only through `archiveOpenSpecChange`; never use custom OpenSpec archive logic.
- In OpenSpec-native mode, never silently archive through legacy `.ai-factory/specs`.
- Never invent governance changes without evidence from the verified plan.
- When governance updates belong to another owner, use the owning path or return an exact handoff instead of silently skipping the change.
- Never auto-create a PR — always present drafts for user approval.
- If `gh` is unavailable, provide manual instructions instead of failing.
- Keep direct archival writes bounded to the plan status, specs directory, and specs index.
- Do not reintroduce `/aif-done` as the canonical upstream workflow step — this is an AIFHub/Handoff finalizer only.

## Example Requests

- "Finalize this plan."
- "Archive the verified plan."
- "Prepare commit and PR summary."
- "/aif-done"
