# OpenSpec Compatibility

OpenSpec is an optional CLI adapter for the v1 OpenSpec-native artifact protocol.

AIFHub Extension can create and consume OpenSpec-native filesystem artifacts without a local OpenSpec CLI. Validation and archive operations require a compatible CLI.

OpenSpec-native mode uses this layering:

```text
OpenSpec artifacts = canonical truth
OpenSpec CLI = validator / status / instructions / archive adapter
AIFHub skills = UX and orchestration
AI Factory = execution runtime
```

## Supported Versions

| Capability | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AI Factory extension install/use | `ai-factory >=2.11.0 <3.0.0` |
| OpenSpec-native validation/archive | OpenSpec CLI `>=1.3.1 <2.0.0` |
| OpenSpec CLI runtime | Node `>=20.19.0` |
| OpenSpec skills/commands | Not installed by this extension |

AI Factory-only workflows follow AI Factory's runtime support. OpenSpec validation/archive follows the OpenSpec CLI runtime requirement.

## Optional Initialization

Projects may initialize OpenSpec without tool integrations:

```bash
openspec init --tools none
```

This is optional. The extension installer does not run it.

OpenSpec skills and slash commands are not installed by this extension.

## OpenSpec-Native Config

OpenSpec-native mode is selected through `.ai-factory/config.yaml`:

```yaml
aifhub:
  artifactProtocol: openspec
  openspec:
    root: openspec
    installSkills: false
    validateOnPlan: true
    validateOnImprove: true
    validateOnVerify: true
    statusOnVerify: true
    archiveOnDone: true
    useInstructionsApply: true
    compileRulesOnSync: true
    validateOnSync: true
    requireCliForVerify: false
    requireCliForDone: true

paths:
  plans: openspec/changes
  specs: openspec/specs
  state: .ai-factory/state
  qa: .ai-factory/qa
  generated_rules: .ai-factory/rules/generated
```

`installSkills: false` is intentional. AIFHub Extension uses OpenSpec artifacts and `scripts/openspec-runner.mjs` as the optional CLI adapter, not OpenSpec-installed skills or slash commands.

## AIFHub Wrapper Behavior

| AIFHub command | OpenSpec CLI feature |
|---|---|
| `/aif-analyze` | optional `openspec init --tools none` guidance or filesystem skeleton |
| `/aif-plan full` | `openspec validate <change>` when `validateOnPlan` is enabled and CLI is available |
| `/aif-improve` | `openspec validate <change>` when `validateOnImprove` is enabled and CLI is available |
| `/aif-implement` | `openspec instructions apply --change <id>` when `useInstructionsApply` is enabled and CLI is available |
| `/aif-verify` | `openspec validate`, optional `openspec status` evidence, and final `aif-gate-result` with `"gate": "verify"` |
| `/aif-rules-check` | Upstream rules gate plus AIFHub generated-rules overlay for OpenSpec specs/deltas |
| `/aif-done` | `openspec archive <change> --yes` when archive is required |
| `/aif-mode sync` | generated-rule compile plus validate/status according to sync flags |
| `/aif-mode doctor` | CLI, Node, active change, generated rules, latest verify gate, and archive readiness diagnostics |

Do not route users to OpenSpec slash commands such as `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, or `/opsx:archive`.

## Artifact Sync Points

Recommended sync points:

- after `/aif-plan full` or `/aif-improve`: `/aif-mode sync --change <change-id>`
- after spec/task edits during implementation or fix: `/aif-mode sync --change <change-id>`
- after `/aif-done` archive: `/aif-mode sync`

`/aif-mode sync` compiles generated rules and requests OpenSpec validation/status when configured and available. Missing OpenSpec CLI is degraded mode for sync validation, not an install failure.

When no active changes exist after archive, `/aif-mode sync` still refreshes `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-base.md` from `openspec/specs/**`, skips change-specific generated rules, skips change validation, writes a sync report, and returns OK.

For `/aif-mode sync --all`, selected active changes without `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md` delta specs are reported as `no-delta-specs` warnings and skipped for sync validation. Changes with delta specs are still validated/statused when the CLI is available.

## Rules Gate

`/aif-rules-check` is read-only. It uses AIFHub generated rules in OpenSpec-native mode and returns a machine-readable `aif-gate-result` with `gate: "rules"`.

If generated rules are missing or stale, run:

```text
/aif-mode sync --change <change-id>
/aif-rules-check
```

## Mode Controller

`/aif-mode` is the extension-owned controller for artifact protocol changes:

```text
/aif-mode status
/aif-mode openspec
/aif-mode ai-factory
/aif-mode sync
/aif-mode doctor
```

`/aif-mode openspec` ensures:

```text
openspec/config.yaml
openspec/specs/
openspec/changes/
.ai-factory/state/
.ai-factory/qa/
.ai-factory/rules/generated/
```

It does not install OpenSpec skills or commands. If legacy plans exist, it reports migration commands and only runs migration when explicitly approved.

`/aif-mode ai-factory` switches the config marker and legacy paths back to `.ai-factory/plans`, `.ai-factory/specs`, and `.ai-factory/rules`. It does not delete `openspec/`.

## OpenSpec-Native Planning

`/aif-plan full` remains the public planning entrypoint. In OpenSpec-native mode it creates:

```text
openspec/changes/<change-id>/
  proposal.md
  design.md
  tasks.md
  specs/<capability>/spec.md
```

It does not create `.ai-factory/plans/<id>.md` or `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/task.md` in OpenSpec-native mode. Missing or unsupported OpenSpec CLI is degraded validation, not planning failure.

## Capability Shape

`scripts/openspec-runner.mjs` exposes capability detection with this stable minimum:

```yaml
openspec:
  available: boolean
  canValidate: boolean
  canArchive: boolean
  version: string | null
  supportedRange: ">=1.3.1 <2.0.0"
  requiresNode: ">=20.19.0"
```

The current runner also reports operational detail fields:

```yaml
openspec:
  nodeVersion: string
  nodeSupported: boolean
  versionSupported: boolean
  command: string
  reason: string | null
  errors:
    - code: string
      message: string
```

Commands should treat the stable minimum as the contract and the operational detail fields as diagnostics.

## Degraded Mode

When the OpenSpec CLI is missing or unsupported:

- extension install remains valid
- OpenSpec-native planning can still write `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`
- generated-rules and execution context may continue from filesystem artifacts
- `/aif-verify` records degraded validation unless strict config requires CLI availability
- `/aif-done` fails archive-required finalization because archive requires a compatible CLI

When Node is below `>=20.19.0`, the CLI is treated as unavailable for validate/archive capabilities even if an `openspec` command exists.

## Prompt Assets and Runtime Integration

OpenSpec-native prompt assets are mode-gated. They keep canonical changes under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`, read generated rules as derived guidance, and write runtime state or QA evidence under `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` and `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`.

Scoped runtime integrations are already documented in the active prompt assets: #31 covers implementation/fix runtime state alignment, #32 covers verify validate/status runtime behavior, and done finalization covers archive/finalizer integration.

## Validation and Archive

Validation uses:

```bash
openspec validate <change-id> --type change --strict --json --no-interactive --no-color
```

Status evidence uses:

```bash
openspec status --change <change-id> --json --no-color
```

Archive-required finalization uses:

```bash
openspec archive <change-id> --yes --no-color
```

`/aif-done --skip-specs` may add `--skip-specs` for docs/tooling-only changes.
