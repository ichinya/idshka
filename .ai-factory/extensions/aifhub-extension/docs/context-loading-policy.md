# Context Loading Policy

This policy defines which artifacts AIFHub Extension commands load and which artifacts they may write.

OpenSpec-native v1 has one core rule: canonical requirements and change intent live under `openspec/`; runtime state, QA evidence, and generated rules live under `.ai-factory/`.

OpenSpec CLI integration is a runner-backed adapter. Commands may request validation, status, instructions, and archive through `scripts/openspec-runner.mjs`, but they must not install or invoke OpenSpec slash-command skills.

## Modes

### OpenSpec-Native Mode

OpenSpec-native mode is selected when `.ai-factory/config.yaml` contains:

```yaml
aifhub:
  artifactProtocol: openspec
```

In this mode, plan-aware commands resolve active work from `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`, not from `.ai-factory/plans/`.

`/aif-mode openspec` is the mode-switching entrypoint. It may update config and ensure skeleton directories, but it does not create feature-specific canonical change content by itself.

### Legacy AI Factory-Only Mode

Legacy AI Factory-only mode uses the older companion plan model:

```text
.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>.md
.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>/
```

These paths remain supported only for legacy compatibility and explicit migration input.

`/aif-mode ai-factory` switches the config path profile back to this model. It preserves `openspec/` and treats OpenSpec-to-legacy output as compatibility export only.

## Base Context

Consumer commands load these project context files when present:

- `.ai-factory/config.yaml`
- `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`
- `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.ai-factory/RULES.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/base.md`
- configured area rules from `.ai-factory/config.yaml`

Consumer commands must not use bridge files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `QWEN.md`, or `AIFACTORY.md` as substitutes for configured context paths.

## OpenSpec-Native Context Set

Plan-aware consumer commands load these canonical artifacts:

- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/**/spec.md`

They may also load derived/runtime artifacts:

- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-base.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-change-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-merged-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/**`
- `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/**`

Generated rules are derived guidance only. If generated rules conflict with canonical OpenSpec artifacts, canonical OpenSpec artifacts win.

Runner output from OpenSpec CLI commands is runtime guidance or evidence. It does not replace the canonical filesystem artifacts under `openspec/`.

## Command Ownership

| Command | May write canonical OpenSpec artifacts | May write runtime or QA artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| `/aif-mode` | skeleton only; never manual `openspec/specs/**` mutations | mode reports, generated rules, optional migration/export outputs |
| `/aif-analyze` | Optional `openspec/` skeleton only when configured | capability/config setup |
| `/aif-plan full` | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `specs/**/spec.md` | optional `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-explore` | no | `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md`, `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-improve` | `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `specs/**/spec.md` | optional `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-implement` | no, unless explicitly requested for selected scope | `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/implementation/` |
| `/aif-fix` | no, unless explicitly requested for selected finding scope | `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/fixes/` |
| `/aif-verify` | no | `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-rules-check` | no | no |
| `/aif-done` | `openspec/specs/**` only through OpenSpec CLI archive | `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`, `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/final-summary.md` |

## Legacy Artifact Boundaries

These files are legacy AI Factory-only artifacts or migration input only:

- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/task.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/context.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/rules.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/verify.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/status.yaml`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/explore.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/fixes/*.md`

OpenSpec-native commands must not require those files and must not create them as part of normal OpenSpec-native execution.

## Migration Context

Legacy migration is explicit. It reads `.ai-factory/plans` artifacts and writes:

- canonical migrated artifacts under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`
- preserved runtime notes under `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/`
- preserved legacy verification evidence under `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`

Migration never silently deletes legacy source artifacts and never writes migrated artifacts under `openspec/specs/`.

See [Legacy Plan Migration](legacy-plan-migration.md).

## Compatibility Export

OpenSpec-to-legacy compatibility export is optional and lossy. It may write:

- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/task.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/context.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/rules.md`

The export does not make OpenSpec artifacts obsolete and does not delete or archive them. Existing legacy files are not overwritten unless the caller explicitly approves overwrite behavior.

## Generated Rules

`.ai-factory/rules/generated/` is owned by the OpenSpec generated-rules compiler. Files in that directory are safe to delete and regenerate from:

```text
openspec/specs/**/spec.md
openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md
```

Read-only gates report missing or stale generated rules as warnings and do not regenerate them automatically.

`/aif-mode sync` owns regeneration of generated OpenSpec rules for mode maintenance. Consumer commands should still treat generated rules as derived guidance rather than source of truth.

## Fallback Behavior

If `.ai-factory/config.yaml` is missing or incomplete:

- consumer commands stop when they cannot resolve required paths safely
- they should suggest `/aif-analyze` to initialize or repair config
- they must not fabricate canonical artifacts from chat context alone
