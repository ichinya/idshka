# Context Loading Policy

This policy defines which artifacts AIFHub Extension commands load and which artifacts they may write.

OpenSpec-native v1 has one core rule: canonical requirements and change intent live under `openspec/`; runtime state, QA evidence, and generated rules live under `.ai-factory/`.

OpenSpec CLI integration is a runner-backed adapter. Commands may request validation, status, instructions, and archive through `scripts/openspec-runner.mjs`, but they must not install or invoke OpenSpec slash-command skills.

## Modes

### OpenSpec-Native Mode

OpenSpec-native mode is selected when `.ai-factory/config.yaml` contains:

```yaml
aifhub:
  artifactProtocol: openspec
```

In this mode, plan-aware commands resolve active work from `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`, not from `.ai-factory/plans/`.

`/aif-mode openspec` is the mode-switching entrypoint. It may update config and ensure skeleton directories, but it does not create feature-specific canonical change content by itself.

### Legacy AI Factory-Only Mode

Legacy AI Factory-only mode uses the older companion plan model:

```text
.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>.md
.ai-factory/plans/<plan-id>/
```

These paths remain supported only for legacy compatibility and explicit migration input.

`/aif-mode ai-factory` switches the config path profile back to this model. It preserves `openspec/` and treats OpenSpec-to-legacy output as compatibility export only.

## Base Context

Consumer commands load these project context files when present:

- `.ai-factory/config.yaml`
- `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`
- `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.ai-factory/RULES.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/base.md`
- configured area rules from `.ai-factory/config.yaml`

Consumer commands must not use bridge files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `QWEN.md`, or `AIFACTORY.md` as substitutes for configured context paths.

## OpenSpec-Native Context Set

Plan-aware consumer commands load these canonical artifacts:

- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/**/spec.md`

They may also load derived/runtime artifacts:

- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-base.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-change-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/rules/generated/openspec-merged-<change-id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/**`
- `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/**`

Generated rules are derived guidance only. If generated rules conflict with canonical OpenSpec artifacts, canonical OpenSpec artifacts win.

Runner output from OpenSpec CLI commands is runtime guidance or evidence. It does not replace the canonical filesystem artifacts under `openspec/`.

## GitHub-Aware Roadmap Context

`/aif-roadmap` may additionally read GitHub and git-tracker context when available:

- GitHub milestones, issues, PRs, labels, and linked branches
- current git tree, changed files, tags, and recent commits

This context is supporting evidence only. Closed GitHub issues, completed milestones, and merged PRs do not by themselves make roadmap items `done`; local evidence from OpenSpec artifacts, source files, tests, CI, runtime state, QA evidence, or generated rules remains required.

GitHub access is non-blocking. If `gh`, connector data, network access, authentication, or rate limits prevent complete GitHub evidence loading, `/aif-roadmap` should continue from local evidence and summarize whether GitHub evidence was unavailable or partial.

`/aif-roadmap` may update only the configured roadmap artifact. It must not mutate GitHub issues, milestones, PRs, labels, linked branches, canonical OpenSpec artifacts, runtime state, QA evidence, generated rules, or implementation files. It must not write tokens, authorization headers, raw credential helper output, or private authentication diagnostics into roadmap output.

## Command Ownership

| Command | May write canonical OpenSpec artifacts | May write runtime or QA artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| `/aif-mode` | skeleton only; never manual `openspec/specs/**` mutations | mode reports, generated rules, optional migration/export outputs |
| `/aif-analyze` | Optional `openspec/` skeleton only when configured | capability/config setup |
| `/aif-roadmap` | no | no |
| `/aif-plan full` | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `specs/**/spec.md` | optional `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-explore` | no | `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md`, `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-improve` | `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `specs/**/spec.md` | optional `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-implement` | no, unless explicitly requested for selected scope | `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/implementation/` |
| `/aif-fix` | no, unless explicitly requested for selected finding scope | `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/fixes/` |
| `/aif-verify` | no | `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-rules-check` | no | no |
| `/aif-review` | no | no |
| `/aif-security-checklist` | no | no |
| `/aif-done` | `openspec/specs/**` only through OpenSpec CLI archive | `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`, `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/final-summary.md` |
| `/aif-commit` | no | git commit only |
| `/aif-evolve` | no | skill-context or evolution artifacts only |

`/aif-roadmap` writes only the configured roadmap artifact, `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` by default.

## Quality Gates and Finalization Tail

OpenSpec-native quality gates:

| Command | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `/aif-rules-check` | generated rules, project rules, changed files, optional OpenSpec context | none |
| `/aif-review` | changed files, OpenSpec context, generated rules | none |
| `/aif-security-checklist` | changed files, OpenSpec context, generated rules | none |
| `/aif-verify` | canonical OpenSpec artifacts, generated rules, runtime state, gate outputs when available | `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/` |
| `/aif-done` | passing verify evidence, verify gate result, OpenSpec change | final QA/state evidence and OpenSpec archive via CLI |
| `/aif-commit` | staged changes, done evidence, final summary, OpenSpec archive/spec changes | git commit |
| `/aif-evolve` | patches, evidence, skill-context inputs | skill-context/evolution artifacts |

`/aif-done` owns OpenSpec lifecycle finalization. `/aif-commit` owns git commit creation. `/aif-evolve` owns learning/evolution.

After `/aif-done`, `/aif-commit` may read finalization evidence and OpenSpec archive/spec mutations, but must not mutate OpenSpec lifecycle artifacts manually.

## Legacy Artifact Boundaries

These files are legacy AI Factory-only artifacts or migration input only:

- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/task.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/context.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/rules.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/verify.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/status.yaml`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/explore.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/fixes/*.md`

OpenSpec-native commands must not require those files and must not create them as part of normal OpenSpec-native execution.

## Migration Context

Legacy migration is explicit. It reads `.ai-factory/plans` artifacts and writes:

- canonical migrated artifacts under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`
- preserved runtime notes under `.ai-factory/state/<change-id>/`
- preserved legacy verification evidence under `.ai-factory/qa/<change-id>/`

Migration never silently deletes legacy source artifacts and never writes migrated artifacts under `openspec/specs/`.

See [Legacy Plan Migration](legacy-plan-migration.md).

## Compatibility Export

OpenSpec-to-legacy compatibility export is optional and lossy. It may write:

- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/task.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/context.md`
- `.ai-factory/plans/<id>/rules.md`

The export does not make OpenSpec artifacts obsolete and does not delete or archive them. Existing legacy files are not overwritten unless the caller explicitly approves overwrite behavior.

## Generated Rules

`.ai-factory/rules/generated/` is owned by the OpenSpec generated-rules compiler. Files in that directory are safe to delete and regenerate from:

```text
openspec/specs/**/spec.md
openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**/spec.md
```

Read-only gates report missing or stale generated rules as warnings and do not regenerate them automatically.

`/aif-mode sync` owns regeneration of generated OpenSpec rules for mode maintenance. Consumer commands should still treat generated rules as derived guidance rather than source of truth.

## Fallback Behavior

If `.ai-factory/config.yaml` is missing or incomplete:

- consumer commands stop when they cannot resolve required paths safely
- they should suggest `/aif-analyze` to initialize or repair config
- they must not fabricate canonical artifacts from chat context alone
